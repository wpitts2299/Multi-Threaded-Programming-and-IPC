## Abstract

This project explores the implementation of multi-threading and interprocess communication (IPC) using pipes. It demonstrates parallel computations with multiple threads, synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions, and efficient data transmission between processes.

## Keywords

Multi-threading, IPC, Synchronization, Pipes

## Introduction

This project focuses on implementing multi-threading and interprocess communication using pipes in C#. The primary objective is to demonstrate parallel computations using at least 10 threads, synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions, and efficient data handling between processes.

## Implementation Details

The code consists of a BankAccount class with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations, and a Program class to demonstrate multi-threading and IPC using named pipes.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu Linux with .NET SDK installed.
- Programming Language: C#.
- Tools: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), gcc, gdb, and Linux process management utilities.
- Dependencies: .NET Core libraries for threading and pipes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install .NET SDK:** Follow the instructions on the official .NET website to install the .NET SDK for your operating system: [Install .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine and run in vscode:
